/*
CTEs are dumb.
* Don't materialize
* Unsupported tricks to "fence" them off
* Can be okay to focus on small amounts of data

Long select lists are brutal
* Nice narrow indexes don't get used
* Optimizer has some bias against key lookups
* Writing your own key lookups can be faster

Temp tables are often the better choice!
