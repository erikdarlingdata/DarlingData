-- Here are some example calls to get you started.

-- To capture all types of ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù queries that have run for at least one second, for 20 seconds, from a specific database

EXEC dbo.sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = 'query',
    @query_duration_ms = 1000,
    @seconds_sample = 20,
    @database_name = 'YourMom';

-- Maybe you want to filter out queries that have asked for a bit of memory:

EXEC dbo.sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = 'query',
    @query_duration_ms = 1000,
    @seconds_sample = 20,
    @requested_memory_mb = 1024;

-- Or maybe you want to find unparameterized queries from a poorly written app that constructs strings in ugly ways, but it generates a lot of queries so you only want data on about a third of them.

EXEC dbo.sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = 'compilations',
    @client_app_name = N'GL00SNIF–Ø',
    @session_id = 'sample',
    @sample_divisor = 3;

-- Perhaps you think queries recompiling are the cause of your problems! Heck, they might be. Have you tried removing recompile hints? üòÅ

EXEC dbo.sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = 'recompilations',
    @seconds_sample = 30;

-- Look, blocking is annoying. Just turn on RCSI, you goblin. Unless you‚Äôre not allowed to.

EXEC dbo.sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = 'blocking',
    @seconds_sample = 60,
    @blocking_duration_ms = 5000;

-- If you want to track wait stats, this‚Äôll work pretty well. Keep in mind ‚Äúall‚Äù is a focused list of ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù waits to queries, not every wait stat.

EXEC dbo.sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = 'waits',
    @wait_duration_ms = 10,
    @seconds_sample = 100,
    @wait_type = N'all';

-- Note that THREADPOOL is SOS_WORKER in xe-land. why? I dunno.

EXEC dbo.sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = 'waits',
    @wait_duration_ms = 100,
    @seconds_sample = 10,
    @wait_type = N'SOS_WORKER,RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE';

-- For some event types that allow you to set a minimum duration, I‚Äôve set a default minimum to try to avoid you introducing a lot of observer overhead to the server. If you understand the potential danger here, or you‚Äôre just trying to test things, you need to use the @gimme_danger parameter. You would also use this if you wanted to set an impermanent session to run for longer than 10 minutes.

-- For example, if you run this command:

EXEC sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = N'query',
    @query_duration_ms = 1;

-- You‚Äôll see this message in the output:

-- Checking query duration filter
-- You chose a really dangerous value for @query_duration
-- If you really want that, please set @gimme_danger = 1, and re-run
-- Setting @query_duration to 500


-- You need to use this command instead:

EXEC sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = N'query',
    @query_duration_ms = 1,
    @gimme_danger = 1;

--  Logging Data To Tables

-- First, you need to set up permanent sessions to collect data. You can use commands like these to do that, but I urge you to add some filters like above to cut down on the data collected. On busy servers, over-collection can cause performance issues.


EXEC sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = N'compiles',
    @keep_alive = 1;

EXEC sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = N'recompiles',
    @keep_alive = 1;


EXEC sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = N'query',
    @keep_alive = 1;

EXEC sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = N'waits',
    @keep_alive = 1;

EXEC sp_HumanEvents
    @event_type = N'blocking',
    @keep_alive = 1;


-- Once your sessions are set up, this is the command to tell sp_HumanEvents which database and schema to log data to.
-- Table names are created internally, so don‚Äôt worry about those.

EXEC sp_HumanEvents
    @output_database_name = N'YourDatabase',
    @output_schema_name = N'dbo';

-- Ideally, you‚Äôll stick this in an Agent Job, so you don‚Äôt need to rely on an SSMS window being open all the time.
-- The job creation code linked is set to check in every 10 seconds, in case of errors.
-- Internally, this will run in its own loop with a WAITFOR of 5 seconds to flush data out.


-- Part of what gets installed when you log data to tables are some views in the same database.

-- You can check in on them like this:

/*Queries*/
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_Queries;
/*Waits*/
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_WaitsByQueryAndDatabase;
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_WaitsByDatabase;
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_WaitsTotal;
/*Blocking*/
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_Blocking;
/*Compiles, only on newer versions of SQL Server*/
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_CompilesByDatabaseAndObject;
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_CompilesByQuery;
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_CompilesByDuration;
/*Otherwise*/
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_Compiles_Legacy;
/*Parameterization data, if available (comes along with compiles)*/
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_Parameterization;
/*Recompiles, only on newer versions of SQL Server*/
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_RecompilesByDatabaseAndObject;
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_RecompilesByQuery;
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_RecompilesByDuration;
/*Otherwise*/
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM dbo.HumanEvents_Recompiles_Legacy;
