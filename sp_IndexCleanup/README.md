# This is the BETA VERSION of sp_IndexCleanup

It needs lots of love and testing in real environments with real indexes to fix many issues:
 * Data collection
 * Deduping logic
 * Result correctness
 * Edge cases

 If you run this, only use the output to debug validate result correctness.

 Do not run any of the output scripts, period. Doing so may be harmful.
