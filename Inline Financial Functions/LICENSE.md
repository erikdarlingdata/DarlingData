Everything in this folder is presented without any license whatsoever. These are common financial calculations used in a wide variety of industries, 
and one of my clients was nice enough to let me publish work I did for them here for general use.

I take no credit for the code presented here, aside from putting it into inline table valued functions to avoid the performance issues caused by scalar valued functions.

All of the calculations were put together by other people, and the original source is unknown to me. If you're reading this and can provide attribution, you may open an issue to do so.

Please review the code carefully for logical correctness, usage applicability, and adherence to the regulations of your industry. I can make no guarantees that these will conform to your specific needs, legal or logical.
