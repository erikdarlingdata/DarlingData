# Contributing to the Darling Data Repository

Welcome aboard! Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'll try to keep it short.

If you're new to GitHub, here's an excellent guide on contributing by Rob Sewell: [How to fork a GitHub repository and contribute to an open source project](https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/how-to-fork-a-github-repository-and-contribute-to-an-open-source-project/)

## Reporting Bugs

Check out the [Github issues list], just in case someone already opened a similar issue. You should also check the [closed issues list], too, because I may have already fixed the issue.

You should use the template for reporting bugs, to provide as much detail as possible. All of my stored procedures should have a `@debug` parameter that can help you track down more detail, too.

Please make sure all pull requests point to the dev branch, and not the main branch.

## Requesting Features

I fully encourage anyone who is interested in adding features or fixing bugs to do so. 

I also understand that working on someone else's code can be intimidating, so if you've got cold feet, just say so. I won't make fun of you, or your feet.

Likewise, please don't be disappointed if I don't want to spend time building a feature you suggest. 

As much as I'd like everyone to be happy with my tools, I work on them in my spare time, and can't do free development for everything and everyone.

Please make sure all pull requests point to the dev branch, and not the main branch.

## Working On Code

Please open an issue for any pull request that you're making. I do welcome all contributions, but I don't want you to do a bunch of work until we've hashed out the details.

There is a template for feature requests that asks some important questions, and it's usually a good idea to follow it.

I am guilty of not doing that at times, but it's my repo, and I abuse the issues feature a bit to make notes for myself.

Please make sure all pull requests point to the dev branch, and not the main branch.

## Code Standards

Your code needs to compile & run on all currently supported versions of SQL Server. 

I try to make things backwards compatible as far as I can, because I do run into client work on older versions, but I don't expect you to do that.

Your code should be set up to handle
* Case sensitivity
* Unicode object names

I have a particular formatting style that I stick to. You can code things however you are comfortable, but don't be surprised or angry if I format things my way.
* Trailing commas
* Spaces, not tabs
* Reasonable casing (not all upper, not all lower)
* Keywords on new lines (from, join, on, where, and, or, order by, group by)
* Indenting things appropriately
* Using AS in aliases
* Column aliases using the "column = expression" format
* Parentheses in TOP expressions, e.g. TOP (1000)
* Aligning parentheses 

Please make sure all pull requests point to the dev branch, and not the main branch.
